= Testimonials =
> ClinicalWP is a must have set of tools for any WordPress website. It makes my job as a WordPress designer so much easier and gives me complete control and saves me hours of work every time I build a site. Not only does it take care of the obvious things like SEO, Caching and anti-SPAM, it also has neat feature like removing nag notices that clog-up the WordPress dashboard. Things that you don’t realise you need until you try it for the first time.


> ClinicalWP is the Swiss Army Knife of WordPress plugins, It really does what its team say! It replaces at least 10 other plugins, including those which are essential for wordpress admins on every site they build.


> This is just too good! ClinicalWP brings together so many of the little things (and big things) that have been missing in WordPress or have required a number of individual plugins just to come close to. I’m pretty practical and not one to get to excited about glib promises or promotional hype, but ClinicalWP truly excels in delivering what it promises. I will be recommending this to my clients and WordPress users at large. Nice!


> ClinicalWP is simply great! There are some brilliant options you can make use of on every WordPress website. Everything is very easy to find, and the options make configuration a really easy thing to do. I also love the fact that it makes debugging code really easy with it’s maintenance features. It also does unique & useful things like integrating into slack, notfying me when my site needs updating.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does ClinicalWP work well with all platforms? =
We build ClinicalWP and all the extensions to work specifically with all recent major Apache versions. We've tested it extensive on Apache & Ubuntu systems. It's also had some testing on Windows Server 2016 and therefore IIS, but not as extensively as we would like. Unfortunately we can't test every Operating System or Web Server, but we are open to feedback. If you spot an issue, let us know and we'll do our best to fix it.

= Does ClinicalWP support my language? =
ClinicalWP uses UK English as the default language, we also include translation in German formal. If you are able to provide translation in another language or dialect, please get in touch. We may be able to trade your translation for a ClinicalWP Pro license.

= Is multisite supported? =
We haven't done any in-depth testing of ClinicalWP or any of it's extensions on a multisite setup. However, we are not currently aware of any issues that would prevent it from working with multisite. If you do see any unexpected bahaviour, please let us know and we'll do our best to resolve the issue.

= Do I need to upgrade to Pro? =
No! We 100% believe in Open Source software, hence this plugin will always remain free of cost. However, there are some additional advantages to upgrading ClinicalWP Pro via range of Extensions/add-ons. For just a few $ you get access to numerous extra options, tweaks and optimisations plus High Priority Support. Pro Extensions: offering Security, anti-Spam, Image Optimisation, Caching & much more.
